# What is this blog about?

I will use this blog as an opportunity to form my opinions about the security and privacy landscape in the web domain. I will also write about any interesting tips and tricks in programming that I come across. Finally, I will share insights I gather from my journey as a researcher.

# Why did I start this blog?

I think that writing is a great way to pace your ideas, and form a coherent thought process. It can also help future researchers who might be interested in the same topics as me. I hope that this blog will be a great resource for them.

# Are you interested in collaborating?

I am always open to collaborations. If you have an interesting idea, or a project that you think I might be interested in, feel free to reach out to me. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
